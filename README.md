# cnn_visualisations

You can check the pre made visualisations in saved visualisation folder 

# How to get started

1) Either create a conda environment or a virtual environmnet
2) You will be needing Tensorflow, Keras and matplotlib. so go ahead and install it.
3) Run the CNN-Visualizations.ipynb file or cnn_train.py


Since the model is trained using cfar 10 datasets where image size is very small so the actiavtion maps as well as filters are bit difficult to understand. So my next update will be to change the model and use imagenet datasets
